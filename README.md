To use this tool, we need to talk with the `captain.py`. It manages the 
other resources and assign tasks and data. Although it can be done
directly, but you need to understand how the flow works.

Usage:
```
captain.py [-h] [--files FILES [FILES ...]] [--slicesize SLICESIZE]
```

# requirements
* `docker`
* `docker-compose`
* `python 2.7`
